We are happy to announce that Zenodo has been accepted as a mentoring organisation for [Google Summer of Code 2017](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/4630502569934848/)!

It's a great opportunity for university students to contribute to Zenodo and make an impact on Open Science.
By applying with us you will be able to work on several projects such as public researcher profiles, research data metadata extraction, spam filtering (using machine learning!) and more.

See our full **[list of project ideas](https://github.com/zenodo/zenodo/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-2017#ideas-list)**.

### What is Google Summer of Code (GSoC)?

GSoC involves a remote, full-time software development work for three months during summer.
An exempt from the official GSoC page:

> "Google Summer of Code is a global program focused on introducing students to open source software development.
  Students work on a 3 month programming project with an open source organization during their break from university."
>
  (...)

> "As a part of Google Summer of Code, student participants are paired with a mentor from the participating organizations, gaining exposure to real-world software development and techniques.
  Students have the opportunity to spend the break between their school semesters earning a stipend while working in areas related to their interests.
  In turn, the participating organizations are able to identify and bring in new developers who implement new features and hopefully continue to contribute to open source even after the program is over.
  Most importantly, more code is created and released for the use and benefit of all."

More information on the [official GSoC page](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/about/).

### Who can take part?

In short, university students from accredited universities that are at least 18 years of age and eligible to work in their country.
Full conditions can be found in the [GSoC FAQ](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq) under *"What are the eligibility requirements for participation?"*.

Since Zenodo is a web platform, a good knowledge of Python, web development, relational databases and object oriented programming is required if you want to apply with us.

### When does it start?

It has already started! You still have time until 3rd of April to submit a proposal with us, but if you're considering applying, you should start getting familiar our project as soon as possible.
This will increase your chances of being selected! See the [GSoC Timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline).
