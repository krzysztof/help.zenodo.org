          <h2>(All) Research.<br> Shared.</h2>
          <h4>— your one stop research shop!</h4>
          <p>all research outputs from across all fields of research are welcome! Zenodo accepts any file format as well as both positive and negative results. We choose to promote peer-reviewed openly accessible research, and we curate the uploads posted on the front-page.</p>

          <h2>Citeable.<br>Discoverable.</h2>
          <h4>— be found!</h4>
          <p>Zenodo assigns all publicly available uploads a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) to make the upload easily and uniquely citeable. Zenodo further supports harvesting of all content via the OAI-PMH protocol.</p>

          <h4>— create your own repository</h4>
          <p>Zenodo allows you to create your own collection and accept or reject uploads submitted to it. Creating a space for your next workshop or project has never been easier. Plus, everything is citeable and discoverable!</p>

          <h2>Safe</h2>
          <h4>— more than just a drop box!</h4>
          <p>Your research output is stored safely for the future in same cloud infrastructure as research data from CERN's [Large Hadron Collider](http://home.web.cern.ch/about/accelerators/large-hadron-collider) and using CERN's battle-tested repository software [INVENIO](http://inveniosoftware.org), which is used by some of the world's largest repositories such as [INSPIRE HEP](http://inspirehep.net) and [CERN Document Server](http://cds.cern.ch).</p>

          <h2>Reporting</h2>
          <h4>— tell your funding agency!</h4>
          <p>Zenodo is integrated into reporting lines for research funded by the European Commission via [OpenAIRE](http://www.openaire.eu). Just upload your research to Zenodo, and we will take care of the reporting for you. We plan to expand this feature with further funding agencies in the future, so stay tuned!</p>

          <h2>Flexible Licensing</h2>
          <h4>— not everything is under Creative Commons</h4>
          <p>Zenodo encourages you to share your research as openly as possible to maximize use and re-use of your research results. However, we also acknowledge that one size does not fit all. Therefore, we allow for uploading under a variety of different licenses and access levels<super>*</super>.<br><small class="text-muted">* You are responsible for respecting applicable copyright and license conditions for the files you upload.</small></p>
